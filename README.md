This is a React Native Mobile App that keeps score for card games. I'm learning React Native and this project is a personal challenge to see if I still have some coding skills in me.

Many parts are graciously copied from other repo's and tutorials. I should have kept a record which ones. But I didn't. So I thank everybody that shared their work, wrote blogs about their learnings, asked or answered questions on stackoverflow. It a pleasure to solve these coding riddles (of which there are many) knowing others had the same struggles. That's why I share this project.

So make no mistake. This is a laboratory project at best. Not an example of how to approach or implement React Native.

## Major Components used in this project
